# Code Editors

Blizzard does not require anything fancy to write code with. You can use notepad, vim, a needle on a disk, anything you so choose. To make your life simpler however, we recommend that you use Visual Studio Code. VSCode is a light weight code editor that works on all operating systems and has additional functionalities such as Syntax Highlighting and IntelliSense.

You can download VSCode from the official website [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). The website has tutorials on setting it up and changing your preferences if you desire.

::: tip Additional Editors

If you would like to see a Blizzard extension for a different Code Editor, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/BlizzardLang/Blizzard_Extension/issues/new?labels=help%20wanted&title=Language%20Server%20Extension%20Request) and provide some details about what you would like to see.

## VSCode Extension

Once you have VSCode installed, you can install the Blizzard extension that will add features to help you write Blizzard code. Navigate to the `Extensions` window in VSCode by clicking the icon with 4 squares on the left hand side of the screen. Search for `BLM16.Blizzard` and click the extension that comes up. You can read through the extension details if you desire, and then click install.

This will install the Blizzard extension and provide support features for `.bzz` files, which is the file extension all Blizzard programs use. You have now installed Blizzard and setup a Code Editor to write your programs in!
